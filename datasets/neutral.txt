Should have been pre calibrated. Pretty hard to find deionised water to calibrate this thing.

It's very easy to use since I'm a aquascaper I need this for my job got this for an Amazon prize. However it does not come with the buffer solution and it's really hard to find them. So I tried bisleri water because they PH is at 6.8 but what a failure u simply need the buffer. Hope they add that as well. And there is no reset button.
