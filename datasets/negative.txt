I would give 4 stars if the packaging was better. The oils smell great, some are rather thin. I've purchased large 4 oz bottles that came broken, 10ml bottles which were fine, and now these 5ml bottles which have come broken because the boxes do not have any dividers or cushioning to keep them from rolling into each other.
